Aim:-
The Aim of this experiment is to verify Thevenin Theorem.

Objectives:-
Learning Objectives:- The objective of this experiment is to examine an application of Thevenin’s Theorem.
To measure Thevenin voltage in a circuit.
To measure Thevenin equivalent resistance in a circuit.
To compute the load current (IL) flowing through (RL) by using the Thevenin Formula.
                    IL = Vth/(Rth + RL)
To Verify Thevenin’s Theorem by comparing analytically calculated values with practical one.

Procedure:-
STEP 1: Set the values of resistances R1, R2, R3, RL by adjusting the sliders.
STEP 2: Make connections as per the instructions given below:

Case 1: (a) To measure RTH short circuit the terminals for power supply (9-10) and connect Multimeter with circuit (5-11 and 6-13).
(b) Now, Check the connections by clicking on ‘CHECK’ button.
(i) If the connections are ‘Invalid’ click on corresponding label to remove the connection.
(ii) And, If the connections are ‘Right Connections’ then follow the below steps.
(c) Now click on ‘ADD’ button to add the readings in the observation table.
(d) Don’t Reset the experiment, Remove the connections(9-10), (5-11 and 6-13) by clicking on the corresponding labels.

Case 2: (a) Now, Measure VTH by connecting the power supply with the circuit (7-9 and 8-10) and connect the voltmeter (1-11 and 2-13).
(b) Now, Check the connections by clicking on ‘CHECK’ button.
(i) If the connections are ‘Invalid’ click on corresponding label to remove the connection.
(ii) And, If the connections are ‘Right Connections’ then follow the below steps.
(c) Now, Turn on the power supply by clicking on the ‘POWER’ button and vary the voltage by moving the slider.
(d) Now, Click on ‘ADD’ button to add the readings in the observation table.
(e) Don’t Reset the experiment, Remove the connections(1-11 and 2-13) by clicking on the corresponding labels.

Case 3: (a) Now, Measure the IL by connecting the power supply with the circuit (7-9 and 8-10) and connect ammeter (3-11 and 4-12 and 13-14).
(b) Now, Check the connections by clicking on ‘CHECK’ button.
Note: Now, follow the CASE 2 steps after checking the connections till (d) point.
STEP 3 : Now, Click on ‘CALCULATE’ button to calculate the load current(IL).
STEP 4 : In Calculation section, We have to manually calculate the Load current (IL) by using the formula and verify it with the help of ‘VERIFY’ button.
STEP 5 : Click on ‘PRINT’ button to takeout the print of the webpage.
STEP 6 : Click on ‘RESET’ button to reload the webpage.
